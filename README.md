# Project
If you want to start the project, open 2 terminal windows cd into client and server.

Run the command "npm start" in the 1st terminal and run the command "npm run dev" in the second terminal

1. User login, signup page (the app starts with this)

2. In the main page/Dashboard, options

  a. Add goals  b. Continue Progress  c. Suggestion and trending topics (we can find an API to get links to latest topics etc)
  \|/
  a. Add the Name
  -> ask for preferences, videos/articles etc
  -> we show the estimated hours required for completion
  -> get the list of topics, and use API search for each topic
  -> we show the relevent youtube playlists videos based on ratings and also relevent websites for learning
  -> we somehow have to display the options and they should be hyperlinked to the source but the text used should give a breif desciption of the topic as well
  -> then as the user base gets bigger, we can optimize the estimated hours
  KEY POINTS
  WHEN A USER IS RETURNING BACK TO THE APP FROM A LINK, WE ASK FOR RATINGS, AND WE CAN USE THAT DATA TO DISPLAYIN THE RESOURCES
  WE ALSO TRACK THE TIME THEY SPENT
  WE OPEN ALL LINKS WITHIN OUR APP, A DIFF WINDOW THOUGH, TO MAKE SURE THEY AREN'T GETTING DISTRACTED AND IF THEY SWTICH TAB AND SEARCH SOMETHING IRRELEVENT, 
  WE GIVE THEM A MSG
